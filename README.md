Just Created a Colorful ReactJS Project! ðŸŒˆ
I just wrapped up a fun little project using React.
In this project, I built a simple color-changing app where the background transforms based on the color you choose.

Key Concepts used:
useState Hook: Used React's useState hook to manage the color state dynamically. The background color updates in real-time as you click on different color buttons.
Button Interactivity: Created interactive buttons for various colors. Clicking a button triggers a state update, instantly changing the background to the selected color. Checkout the Recording of the Project..!

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
